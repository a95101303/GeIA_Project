abstract = "A new theory is presented for calculating the avalanche multiplication factor M(x) in semiconductors. The integral equation, which determines M(x), takes into account that a particle has to gain a critical energy Uc (threshold energy) from the electric field E(x) in order to be able to ionize lattice and impurity atoms. Therefore, our theory is also applicable to narrow junctions. The input to our theory are the mean free paths and the threshold energies of electrons (Ln, Ucn) and holes (Lp, Ucp), respectively. Approximations to the integral equation for M(x) lead to ionization rates αn(E), αp(E) for electrons and holes, respectively. The dependence of these ionization rates on the electric field is determined analytically and a correction to Chynoweth's law is found. In this paper we merely want to show that the field dependence of the ionization rates given by Chynoweth's law (αsc = αsc exp(-bsc/E) with s = {n, p}) is, in general, a crude approximation within our more general theory. Rather we shall derive an approximation of the following form: αs = aszexp−bsE(x) with z(x) = 1 + bnE(x)exp−bpE(x) and as = 1Ls, bs = UscqLs, s ={n, p} We want to stress that the purpose of our paper is not to determine the physical parameters, as, bs from multiplication factor measurements. Rather we want to convince the reader that our expression of the ionization rate is both a simple and, for narrow junctions, a necessary correction to Chynoweth's law. Considering abrupt p-n junctions with different doping concentrations it is shown that our dependence of ionization rate on electric field E(x) is valid in a range 2 × 105 < E < 6 × 105 V/cm. In contrast to the results by Van Overstraeten and De Man, no splitting of the constants as, bs in a high field and a low field range is required in order to obtain a correct multiplication factor. The arguments used are self contained."

abstract = {The conductivity effective masses of electrons and holes in Si are calculated for carrier temperatures from 1 to 3000 K. The temperature dependence of the electron mass is calculated by use of a phenomenological model of conduction-band nonparabolicity that has been fitted to experimental measurements of the dependence of the electron conductivity effective mass on carrier concentration. The hole mass is investigated by tight-binding calculations of the valence bands, which have been adjusted to match experimental values of the valence-band curvature parameters at the top of the valence band. The calculations are in excellent agreement with femtosecond-laser reflectivity measurements of the change in optical effective mass as hot carriers cool from 1550 to 300 K.},

The charge carrier concentration, mobility and resistivity are measured by Hall Effect system at 77 Kelvin. We investigated the contribution to the total charge drift mobility from ionized impurity scattering, lattice scattering, and neutral impurity scattering with the best theoretical models and experimental data. Several samples with measured Hall mobility from the grown crystals are used for this investigation. With the measured Hall mobility and ionized impurity concentration as well as the theoretical models, we calculated the neutral impurity concentration by the Matthiessen's rule. As a result, the distributions of the neutral impurity concentrations with respect to the radius of the crystals are obtained. Consequently, we demonstrated that neutral impurity scattering is a significant contribution to the charge drift mobility, which has dependence on the concentration of neutral impurities in a given germanium crystal.}

abstract = "Amorphous semiconductor electrical contacts on high-purity Ge radiation detectors have become a valuable technology because they are simple to fabricate, result in thin dead layers, block both electron and hole injection, and can readily be finely segmented as needed for applications requiring imaging or particle tracking. Though significant numbers of detectors have been successfully produced for a variety of applications using the amorphous semiconductor contact technology, there remains a need to better understand the dependence of performance characteristics, particularly leakage current, on the fabrication process parameters so that the performance can be better optimized. To this end, we have performed a systematic study of leakage current on RF-sputter-deposited amorphous-Ge (a-Ge) and amorphous-Si (a-Si) contacts as a function of process and operational parameters including sputter gas pressure and composition, number of detector temperature cycles, and time spent at room temperature. The study focused primarily on the current resulting from electron injection at the contact. Significant findings from the study include that a-Si produces lower electron injection than a-Ge, the time the detector spends at room temperature rather than the number of temperature cycles experienced by the detector is the primary factor associated with leakage current change when the detector is warmed, and the time stability of the a-Ge contact depends on the sputter gas pressure with a higher pressure producing more stable characteristics."

We investigated the detector performance including the I-V characteristics, C-V characteristics and spectroscopy measurements for a few detectors.
